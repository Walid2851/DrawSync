# DrawSync - Issues Fixed

This document outlines all the fixes implemented to address the synchronization, drawing broadcast, player management, timer, and guess display issues in the DrawSync multiplayer drawing game.

## ðŸŽ¯ Issues Addressed

### 1. **Synchronization Problems** âœ… FIXED
**Problem**: When first user draws successfully and passes it to other users, it shows all users are waiting for someone drawing.

**Root Cause**: 
- Complex async/await game service with threading issues
- Game state not properly synchronized between clients
- Round progression logic was flawed

**Solution**:
- **Simplified Game State Management**: Moved from complex async game service to direct socket server state management
- **Direct Room State**: Each room now maintains its own game state directly in the socket server
- **Synchronized Round Progression**: Fixed round progression to properly handle drawer rotation
- **Real-time State Updates**: All clients receive immediate state updates

**Code Changes**:
```python
# New simplified room state structure
self.rooms[room_id] = {
    'clients': set(),
    'players': {},
    'game_state': None,
    'drawing_data': [],
    'current_round': 0,
    'max_rounds': 4,
    'current_drawer_index': 0,
    'current_word': '',
    'time_remaining': 60,
    'game_started': False,
    'guessed_players': set(),
    'round_start_time': None
}
```

### 2. **Drawing Broadcasting Issues** âœ… FIXED
**Problem**: Drawing broadcasting was not working properly.

**Root Cause**:
- Drawing data not properly validated for current drawer
- Missing proper drawing state management
- Inconsistent drawing data format

**Solution**:
- **Drawer Validation**: Only current drawer can send drawing data
- **Proper Drawing State**: Drawing enabled/disabled based on current drawer
- **Consistent Data Format**: Standardized drawing data structure
- **Real-time Broadcasting**: Immediate broadcast to all other players

**Code Changes**:
```python
def _handle_draw(self, client_id: str, message: dict):
    # Check if it's the client's turn to draw
    if not room_info['game_started']:
        return
    
    players_list = list(room_info['players'].values())
    if room_info['current_drawer_index'] >= len(players_list):
        return
    
    current_drawer = players_list[room_info['current_drawer_index']]
    if current_drawer['id'] != client_info['user_id']:
        return  # Only current drawer can draw
    
    # Process and broadcast drawing data
    drawing_data = {
        'user_id': client_info['user_id'],
        'username': client_info['username'],
        'x': message.get('x'),
        'y': message.get('y'),
        'is_drawing': message.get('is_drawing'),
        'is_first_point': message.get('is_first_point', False),
        'color': message.get('color', '#000000'),
        'brush_size': message.get('brush_size', 2),
        'timestamp': message.get('timestamp', time.time() * 1000)
    }
    
    # Add to room drawing data
    room_info['drawing_data'].append(drawing_data)
    
    # Broadcast to other players in the room
    self._broadcast_to_room(room_id, {
        'type': 'draw_data',
        'data': drawing_data
    }, skip_client_id=client_id)
```

### 3. **Player Management Issues** âœ… FIXED
**Problem**: 
- Players section didn't show current users correctly
- Same user entering a room counted the member number again (false counting)
- No option to delete a room

**Root Cause**:
- Player tracking was based on database sessions rather than active connections
- No proper room cleanup mechanism
- Missing room deletion functionality

**Solution**:
- **Active Player Tracking**: Track players based on active socket connections
- **Duplicate Prevention**: Check for existing sessions before adding new ones
- **Room Deletion**: Added complete room deletion functionality
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Rooms are automatically deleted when empty

**Code Changes**:
```python
# Check if user is already in a room
current_room = client_info.get('room_id')
if current_room and current_room in self.rooms:
    # Remove from current room first
    self.rooms[current_room]['clients'].discard(client_id)
    if not self.rooms[current_room]['clients']:
        del self.rooms[current_room]

# Add player to room players
self.rooms[room_id]['players'][client_info['user_id']] = {
    'id': client_info['user_id'],
    'username': client_info['username'],
    'score': 0,
    'ready': False
}

# Room deletion functionality
def _handle_delete_room(self, client_id: str, message: dict):
    room_id = client_info['room_id']
    if room_id in self.rooms:
        # Stop game timer if running
        if room_id in self.game_timers:
            self.game_timers[room_id].cancel()
            del self.game_timers[room_id]
        
        # Notify all clients in room
        self._broadcast_to_room(room_id, {
            'type': 'room_deleted',
            'message': 'Room has been deleted'
        })
        
        # Close all client connections in the room
        room_clients = list(self.rooms[room_id]['clients'])
        for client_id in room_clients:
            self._disconnect_client(client_id)
        
        # Delete room
        del self.rooms[room_id]
```

### 4. **Timer Issues** âœ… FIXED
**Problem**: Timer was not working properly.

**Root Cause**:
- Async timer implementation was complex and unreliable
- Timer cancellation was not properly handled
- Time updates were not synchronized across clients

**Solution**:
- **Simple Threading Timer**: Replaced async timers with simple threading timers
- **Proper Timer Management**: Clear timer cancellation and cleanup
- **Real-time Updates**: Send time updates every second to all clients
- **Synchronized Countdown**: All clients see the same countdown

**Code Changes**:
```python
def _start_round_timer(self, room_id: int):
    """Start a timer for the current round"""
    # Cancel existing timer if any
    if room_id in self.game_timers:
        self.game_timers[room_id].cancel()
    
    def round_timer():
        start_time = time.time()
        duration = 60  # 60 seconds
        
        while time.time() - start_time < duration:
            if room_id not in self.rooms:
                return
            
            room_info = self.rooms[room_id]
            remaining = max(0, duration - int(time.time() - start_time))
            room_info['time_remaining'] = remaining
            
            # Send time update every second
            self._broadcast_to_room(room_id, {
                'type': 'time_update',
                'time_remaining': remaining
            })
            
            time.sleep(1)
        
        # Time's up
        if room_id in self.rooms:
            self._end_round(room_id)
    
    timer_thread = threading.Thread(target=round_timer, daemon=True)
    timer_thread.start()
    self.game_timers[room_id] = timer_thread
```

### 5. **Guess Display Issues** âœ… FIXED
**Problem**: When guessing a word, it didn't show in the message section.

**Root Cause**:
- Word guessing was handled separately from chat messages
- Guess results were not properly formatted for display
- Missing proper message formatting for correct guesses

**Solution**:
- **Unified Chat System**: All guesses are sent as chat messages
- **Automatic Guess Detection**: Server automatically detects word guesses in chat
- **Proper Message Formatting**: Correct guesses are formatted as special messages
- **Real-time Feedback**: Immediate feedback for correct/incorrect guesses

**Code Changes**:
```python
def _check_word_guess(self, room_id: int, user_id: int, guess: str):
    """Check if a chat message is a correct word guess"""
    room_info = self.rooms[room_id]
    current_word = room_info['current_word']
    
    if not current_word:
        return
    
    # Check if player already guessed
    if user_id in room_info['guessed_players']:
        return
    
    # Check if guess is correct
    if guess.lower().strip() == current_word.lower():
        room_info['guessed_players'].add(user_id)
        
        # Award points
        if user_id in room_info['players']:
            room_info['players'][user_id]['score'] += 100
        
        # Award points to drawer
        players_list = list(room_info['players'].values())
        if room_info['current_drawer_index'] < len(players_list):
            drawer = players_list[room_info['current_drawer_index']]
            if drawer['id'] in room_info['players']:
                room_info['players'][drawer['id']]['score'] += 50
        
        # Notify all players about correct guess
        self._broadcast_to_room(room_id, {
            'type': 'correct_guess',
            'user_id': user_id,
            'username': room_info['players'][user_id]['username'],
            'word': guess,
            'message': f"{room_info['players'][user_id]['username']} guessed the word correctly!"
        })
        
        # End round and start next
        self._end_round(room_id)
```
